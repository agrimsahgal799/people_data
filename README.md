<h3>This is a small demonstration of how to generate people's data by using PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, and JSON.</h3>

1. Only the first "data" entry in "source/data.json" will display on page load.

2. After clicking the "Next Person" button, the next sequential "data" entry will load when the button is clicked.

3. This will continue until the final "data" entry is loaded.
